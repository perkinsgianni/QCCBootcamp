          New York City’s dining scene is world-famous for good reason—and no matter the circumstances, restaurants, bars and cafés always find a way to serve the five boroughs. While many venues are open for outdoor dining—and indoor dining can operate at full capacity (proof of vaccination is required)—others offer full menus (including drinks) for takeout, and even temporarily closed spots may offer gift cards.
